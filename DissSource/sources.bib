A method is developed which is exact for bipartite graphs and is an important part of heuristic procedures to find maximal cliques in general graphs. Finally an exact method is given which performs better than the Randall-Brown algorithm and is able to color larger graphs, and the new heuristic methods, the classical methods, and the exact method are compared.},

%% Lewis, A Guide to Graph Colouring 2015 
@book{LewisR.M.R2015AGtG,
abstract = {This book treats graph colouring as an algorithmic problem, with a strong emphasis on practical applications. The author describes and analyses some of the best-known algorithms for colouring arbitrary graphs, focusing on whether these heuristics can provide optimal solutions in some cases; how they perform on graphs where the chromatic number is unknown; and whether they can produce better solutions than other algorithms for certain types of graphs, and why. The introductory chapters explain graph colouring, and bounds and constructive algorithms. The author then shows how advanced, modern techniques can be applied to classic real-world operational research problems such as seating plans, sports scheduling, and university timetabling. He includes many examples, suggestions for further reading, and historical notes, and the book is supplemented by a website with an online suite of downloadable code. The book will be of value to researchers, graduate students, and practitioners in the areas of operations research, theoretical computer science, optimization, and computational intelligence. The reader should have elementary knowledge of sets, matrices, and enumerative combinatorics.},

Here “reduced” means, roughly speaking, that the first problem can be solved deterministically in polynomial time provided an oracle is available for solving the second. From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second. Other examples are discussed. A method of measuring the complexity of proof procedures for the predicate calculus is introduced and discussed.},

We show that n-variable (3,2)-CSP instances can be solved in time O(1.3645n), that satisfying assignments to (d,2)-CSP instances can be found in randomized expected time O((0.4518d)n); that 3-coloring of n-vertex graphs can be solved in time O(1.3289n); that 3-list-coloring of n-vertex graphs can be solved in time O(1.3645n); that 3-edge-coloring of n-vertex graphs can be solved in time O(2n/2), and that 3-satisfiability of a formula with t 3-clauses can be solved in time O(nO(1)+1.3645t).}

Each node in the graph stands for a computed quantity that resides in a machine register, and two nodes are connected by an edge if the quantities interfere with each other, that is, if they are simultaneously live at some point in the object program. This approach, though mentioned in the literature, was never implemented before. Preliminary results of an experimental implementation in a PL/I optimizing compiler suggest that global register allocation approaching that of hand-coded assembly language may be attainable.}

Using this model, which can also be extended to incorporate additional constraints, the difficulty of such problems is then gauged by considering the performance of a number of different graph colouring algorithms. Second, neighbourhood operators are then proposed that can be derived from the underlying graph colouring model and, in an example application, we show how these operators can be used in conjunction with multi-objective optimisation techniques to produce high-quality solutions to a real-world sports league scheduling problem encountered at the Welsh Rugby Union in Cardiff, Wales.}

title = {Iterated greedy graph coloring and the coloring landscape},
author = {Culberson, J},
abstractNote = {The Iterated Greedy (IG) graph coloring algorithm uses the greedy, or simple sequential, graph coloring algorithm repeatedly to obtain ever better colorings. On each iteration, the permutation presented to the greedy algorithm is generated so that the vertices of the independent sets identified in the previous coloring are adjacent in the permutation. It is trivial to prove that this ensures that the new coloring will use no more colors than the previous coloring. On random graphs the algorithm does not perform as well as TABU or semi-exhaustive independent set approaches. It does offer some improvements when combined with these. On k-colorable graphs it seems quite effective, and offers a robustness over a wide range of k, n, p values the other algorithms seem not to have. In particular, evidence indicates that one setting of parameters seems to be {open_quotes}near best{close_quotes} over most of these classes. Evidence also indicates that graphs in the classes we consider that are harder for this algorithm are also more difficult for TABU and semi-exhaustive independent set approaches. Thus, the number of iterations required gives a natural measure of difficulty of the graphs, independent of machine characteristics and many details of implementation.},

Example applications of this generic method are made to two well-known problems belonging to this class: graph colouring and bin packing. Using a wide variety of different problem instance-types, these algorithms are compared to two other generic methods for this problem type: the iterated greedy algorithm and the grouping genetic algorithm. The results of these comparisons indicate that the presented applications of the hill-climbing approach are able to significantly outperform these algorithms in many cases. A number of reasons for these characteristics are given in the presented analyses.}

Unlike many previous computational studies in graph colouring, a large range of both artificially generated and real-world graphs are considered, culminating in over 40,000 individual trials that have consumed more than a decade of computation time in total. The picture painted by the comparison is complex, with each method outperforming all others on at least one occasion; however, general patterns are also observed, particularly with regards to the advantages of hybridising local-search techniques with global-based operators.}
